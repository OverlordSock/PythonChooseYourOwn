# PythonChooseYourOwn
Repository for my ChooseYourOwn Adventure Game Python Prototype 

This python file is the unfinished script for a text based Choose Your Own Adventure game.
The project is unfinished, but includes basic character creation with dynamic pronoun assignment, a backpack function that allows the player to browse their backpack and inspect items in it at regular intervals,
error checking, logic driven Choose Your Own Adventure activities and a basic but inefficient checkpoint system.

When presented with the choice of a direction to pick, choose forward, as the other choices are unfinished.
The project serves as proof of concept for the game, and a future version is in development using Java to expand possibilities.
